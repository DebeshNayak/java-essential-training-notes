Managing resizable arrays with ArrayList:
http://goo.gl/D9k5Tv
- The Java collections framework is a set of interfaces and classes that make it
  easy to manage data in your applications.
- You can manage either ordered or unordered data and you can use one of four categories
  of classes.
- Each of these categories is represented by an interface.
  Named:
  - set,
  - list,
  - dequeue and
  - map.
- Most commonly used classes from this framework are ArrayList, and HashMap.
- These are both implementations of two interfaces.
  - ArrayList implements lists, and HashMap implements map
-----------
- What item the list can contain can be represented by using "generic" notation.
- The generic notation is called "diamond operator" (<>)
- ArrayList contain ordered collection of data. We can call it resizable array.

package com.example.java;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

        list.add("Madhapradesh");
        list.add("Maharastra");
        list.add("West Bangle");

        System.out.println(list);
        list.add("Goa");
        System.out.println(list);

        // remove from list based on its index position
        list.remove(0);
        System.out.println(list);

        // access single item from the list
        // ListArray has 0 based indexing
        String state = list.get(1);
        System.out.println("The second state is " + state);

        int pos = list.indexOf("Goa");
        System.out.println("Goa is at position " + pos);
    }
}
