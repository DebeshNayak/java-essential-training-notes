- When designing an object-oriented, contract-based programming architecture, you
  can frequently choose between using interfaces and abstract classes.
- An abstract class is abstract because you add the abstract keyword and then it
  can contain a mixture of fully implemented methods and abstract methods.
- An abstract method is just like a method in an interface. It doesn't have an
  implementation. It just indicates the method signature and then any subclasses
  of an abstract method must implement that method.
***Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, only their subclasses can be instantiated.
- Abstract classes are similar to interfaces, but it is the choice of application designer to
  choose between these two.
