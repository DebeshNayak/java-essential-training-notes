Creating and implementing interfaces:
-------------------------------------
- In object-oriented programming, an interface is a contract.
- It defines a set of methods with particular signatures.
- Any class that implements that interface must implement those methods.

Example:
- The list and the map.
- These are parts of the collections framework.
--------------
- Instantiating interfaces of code is very common in the world of Android.
- Interfaces are used in Android for event handling, call-back methods, and other more advanced Java programming functionality.

Example: 45-Interfaces project
