Managing files with Apache Commons FileUtils:
- Apache Commons is a project that incorporates utilities for many common tasks.
- The goal of Apache Commons is to take solutions that developers have found,
  and let them share them easily with the rest of the community.
- For file management, there's a special category called Commons IO.
- https://commons.apache.org
- For File Management there is a special category:  https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io
------------------
 - If you're working with the most recent version of Java and you can use the new I/O libraries, I recommend doing that.
 - But if you're working with older versions, or you're working under Android, and
  you want to simplify a lot of these tasks, it's worth looking at these tools.
--------
- Knowing what's in the Apache Commons libraries can help you enormously.
- A lot of the common tasks that you might have to accomplish have already been solved by other Java developers,
- They've shared their solutions through Apache Commons.
