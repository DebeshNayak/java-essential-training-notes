-------------------------------------
- Many Java applications have to communicate over the Internet making requests for
  content and processing the content after downloading it.

- After downloading the XML we might parse the XML content using Document Object Model, JDOM,
  or one of the many other approaches that are available for parsing XML using Java.

- We have seen how to communicate over the Web making requests for content and then
  downloading and getting content ready for processing.
