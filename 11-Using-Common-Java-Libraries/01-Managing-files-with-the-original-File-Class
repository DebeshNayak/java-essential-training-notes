Managing files with the original File class:
--------------------------------------------
- I'm using a syntax style known as try-with-resources.
- Whenever you declare objects within the parentheses after the try keyword
- That means that these objects implement a method named close, or to be more accurate,
  they implement an interface named AutoCloseable.
- All of these objects need to be closed before you finish what you're up to.
- By instantiating the objects in the try-with-resource section, I'll allow the
  Java runtime to call the close methods for me.
---------------
- And if you're working with an older version of Java, you won't be able to use
  it either.
- So instead, you would instantiate these objects within the try block and then
  close them explicitly by calling their close methods before you finish executing your code.
