Managing files with Java 7 new I/O library:
-------------------------------------------
 - In Java 7, a new IO library was introduced that greatly simplified a lot of common operations.
 - You can only use this library in Java 7 and later.
 - Unfortunately, at least at this point, it has not been implemented for Android.
 - So Android developers will still need to use those older classes.

Example: 48-NewIO project
