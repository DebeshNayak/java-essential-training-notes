Memory Management and Garbage Collection:
----------------------------------------
* Memory for objects is allocated automatically.
* Objects are created in heap memory.
  - When we create a variable, it stored in fastest available memory
  - But the object reference is stored in heap memory
  - There are two memory
  +-----------+
  |  heap     |(Little slower, more dynamic)
  +-----------+
  |           |
  |  stack    |(faster memory)
  |           |
  +-----------+
  - When we create variable they might be stored in stack or heap
  - But complex object are stored always in heap
* As long as any variable references an object, that variable is retained.
* When all references expire, the object is eligible for garbage collection.
  - And it is all responsible of garbage collector object when to do that.
------------------
When do references expire?
1. Variables local to methods or code blocks expire with scope.
void changeString(){
  String localVar = "Won't be around for long!";
  System.out.println("In function: "+ localVar);
}
  - As soon as the method is finished executing, that variable is dereferenced.
  - That value, the object is referenced, might stay in memory for little while
    but can't be addressed anymore.
  - So it's eligible for garbage collection
  - The next time the Garbage Collector looks for variables, it can remove it
    reclaim that memory for future use.

2. Explicitly dereference variables with null keyword
  String tempVar = "Won't be around for long!";
  tempVar = null;
----------------
Java Garbage Collector:
* The Garbage Collector object runs in its own thread.
  - Depending on the kind of application you're running
  - Depending on the hardware,
  - The amount of memory and other resources it has.
* Can destroy dereferenced objects, but not required
* Cannot force garbage collection
----------------
System Methods:
* Methods system.gc() and Rutime.gc() can request garbage collectin, but there
  is no gurarantee it will happen or not.
* If no memory is available for a newly requested object, system throws OutOfMemoryError.
  - And it halt the Virtual Machine to a halt state.
----------------
Tips for Managing Memory
* Minimize the number of object you create (try to recycle existing object)
* If concerned, use these methods to find out how much memory is available:
  Runtime.maxMemory() - how much memory has been allocated to the virtual machine
  Runtime.totalMemory() - how much is currently in use
--------------
Setting Available Memory:
* Use command-line options to manage amount of available heap memory
  java -Xms256s HelloWorld  - Initial heap size
  java -Xmx256m HelloWorld  - Maximum heap size
  java -Xmn256n HelloWorld  - Heap size for young generation objects
