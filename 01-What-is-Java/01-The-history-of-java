- The current version of Java is J2SE 8 which internally it is J2SE 1.8.
- Java 5 was the major change for the language in terms of core language syntax, a
  new feature called "Generics" was implemented, that allow to strongly data type
  elements that belonging to collection.

                                              Lambda expressions
                                             and method references
                                            Collections with streams
                                               New date/time API

- At the time of learning Java, Java SE 8 is the latest version of Java for everything
  except "Android Development".
- For Android Developer look for feature of Java SE 6 and Java SE 7.
