Java Syntax and Compilation:
----------------------------
* All code is defined in classes.
* Classes are defined in source code files with .java extension.
* The javac command compiles Java code into bytecode.
* The java command runs compiled bytecode files.
------------
A Simple Java Class:
* Defined in Main.java:

package declaration ------> package com.example;

Class declaration --------> public class Main {

Main method -------------->   public static void main(String[] args){
Executable code----------->     System.out.println("Hello World");
                              }
                            }
-----------
Case sensitivity:
* Java is case sensitive.
  - All identifiers must be unique within their scopes.
  Ex:
  These are different identifiers due to case.
    fristname
    firstName
    FIRSTNAME
------------
White Space
* White space doesn't affect interpretation of code.
* Spaces, tabs, and line feeds are "collapsed" by compiler.
* All statements must end with a semicolon (;).
  System.out.println("hello world")[;] ------> Required
-------------
Identifiers and Keywords
* Keywords can't be used as class or other identifiers:
  https://cods.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html
* Class, method, field, and other names are identifiers.
* Identifiers must start with alpha character or underscore.
  (Can't used numbers and special characters)
-------------
Identifier Conventions:
* Classes start with uppercase character.
  class MyClass
* Methods and variables start with lowercase character
  Ex:
  void doSomething(String withThis) { }
* Constant are all uppercase.
  public static final String FIRSTNAME="Debesh";
  Note:
    - There is no constant keyword in java
    - They are declared by "static final" keyword
    - Static means it is a member of the class
    - Final means it can't be changed.
