- Java developers typically organize their classes in packages.
- A package is a unique identifier that goes at the top of the class declaration.
- But it actually matches a folder hierarchy.
- You can create your Java classes in a project root folder, also known as the base package,
  but to keep your classes well organized, you should start with packages from the very beginning.
-----------------
package com.example.java;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello World from Java");
		System.out.println(args[0]);
	}

}
--------------
- save it inside com/example/java/ folder
- compile it from root folder by
  javac com/example/java/Main.java
- run it by
  java com.example.java.Main "My App"
