Packaging classes in JAR files:
------------------------------
- A JAR file is a Java archive. A file in ZIP format that contains one or more Java
  classes, pre-compiled, so that you can run the JAR file as a complete application.
- This is all done using a tool that's included with the Java Development Kit, called JAR.
- To run a simple jar file enter the following command:
java -jar <jar file name with jar extension>
