Documenting code with Javadoc:
-----------------------------
- The Java Development Kit includes the tool named Javadoc. Javadoc's job is to
  extract documentation about your Java application, including information directly
  drawn from the code, but also from comments that you can put into your code.

- For applications that you want to keep around for a long time, that will need
  to be maintained, then Javadoc Tool is absolutely critical to help you understand
  later what you are programming today.

Example: 51-Javadocs
