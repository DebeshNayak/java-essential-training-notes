Installing java on Windows:
- We need to install Java Development Kit from oracle
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html
- Click on JDK and select the appropriate download
- And install it.
- After installing we need to tell the system where it can find java and java compiler
- So we need to create new environment variable.
  - Go to System Properties
  - Then Environment Variable
  - Create a new environment variable called "JAVA_HOME"
  - And add the "JDK folder" path, not the "JDK/bin" folder path
  - And add the "JDK/bin" path to the "Path" variable
- In command prompt:
java -version
javac -version
