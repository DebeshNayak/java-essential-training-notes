Using static variables as constants:
- A variable, whose value can't be changed.
- There is a const keyword in Java, but it's not currently implemented.
- Instead Java developers create constants using the final keyword.
- Final, when applied to a variable, means that its value can only be set once.
--------------------
- Constants can help you solve a number of programming issues:
  - It helps in elimination of the errors that literal strings are prone to.
  - It can help in coding more quickly
