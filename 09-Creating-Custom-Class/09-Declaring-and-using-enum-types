Declaring and using enum types:
- Enumerations are lists of possible values that you can use for any particular variable.
- An enumeration in java is called an enum class.
- An enum class, either can be created:
  - in using its own separate code file,
  - a nested enum if its only going to be used in one java class.
----------------
- One of the advantages of an enum is that:
  - If you decide to add another value later on, you only have to do it in one place, in the enum itself.
  - If you need to change the way a particular identifier translates to a string, again, it occurs in only one place.
